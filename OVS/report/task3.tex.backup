\section*{Task 3}
We extracted the doubly-linked list of the address book application. To test this implementation, we changed the data structure to use integers as data and used the same \texttt{main} as in Task~2. This also avoids testing the whole address book application, as the address book application as a whole merely offers methods to manipulate this data structure.

\begin{lstlisting}
struct list_element {
 struct list_element *prev;
 struct list_element *next;
 int data; // changed struct address pointer to integer data
};
\end{lstlisting}

We have also applied the workaround to avoid multiple dereferences in one assignment by introducing temporary variables, e.g., 
\begin{lstlisting}
 //elem->prev->next = elem->next;
 struct list_element *elem_prev_element = elem->prev;
 elem_prev_element->next = elem->next;
\end{lstlisting}

This results in a successfully verified program.
